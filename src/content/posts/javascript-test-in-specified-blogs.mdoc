Testing if the following button will show content or not on clicking

### Key Takeways:

- If clicking the button made the content appear, and re-clicking made it disappear, then javascript is also being rendered along with the html and we can add as may components as we want here

- If it doesn't work, then we can only add UI elements and any javascript won't work and custom functionality then could not be added through blogs

- Using an iframe would allow us to add 3rd party interactions through javascript and additional components in the specific blogs

  ```javascript
  <iframe src="https://alpine-iframe.surge.sh"> 
  ```

### JS script tests:

#### Using <script> tag

Press the following button and check if clicking it toggles the content

<div x-data="{ open: false }"> <button @click="open = !open">Expand</button>

<span x-show="open">
Content...
</span>
</div>

#### Using an iframe

The following same usage is being served through an iframe to see if it'd work:

##### without alpinejs cdn import

<iframe src="https://alpine-without-script.surge.sh" title="Alpine example without script tag" width="800" height="600"></iframe>

##### with alpinejs cdn import

<iframe src="https://alpine-with-script.surge.sh" title="Alpine example without script tag" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
