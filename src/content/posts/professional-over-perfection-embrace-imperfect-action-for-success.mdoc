### **The Dark Side of Perfectionism**

Perfectionism is like quicksand—it may seem harmless at first, but it can quickly pull you down. Here’s how it impacts your productivity and creativity:

1. **Analysis Paralysis:** Spending too much time overthinking stops you from taking action.
1. **Fear of Failure:** The thought of making mistakes often kills innovation before it begins.
1. **Time Drain:** Endless revisions and tweaks can leave you exhausted and behind schedule.
1. **Self-Doubt:** Setting unattainable standards can lead to frustration and low self-esteem.
